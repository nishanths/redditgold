I received reddit gold and found the ability to highlight new comments
very comfortable. This extension adds new comment highlighting to non-gold
reddit.

Customize the extensions's options by visiting chrome://extensions. The
default highlighting colors are the ones from /r/soccer.

The extension does not sync last visit times across computers. (Doing so
would require sending this data to Google servers.) So visit times for
comment highlighting is local to each computer. The visit times,
however, are shared across all accounts on a local machine.
