I received reddit gold and found new comment highlighting a comfortable
feature. This extension adds new comment highlighting to non-gold reddit.

Customize the extensions's options by visiting chrome://extensions.

The extension does not sync last visit times across computers. (Doing so
would require sending this data to Google servers.) So comment
highlighting is local to each computer.
